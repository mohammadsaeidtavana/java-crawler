# Coding Standards and Security Guidelines

## Clean Code Standards
This section outlines the fundamental principles and best practices of Clean Code, including readability, maintainability, modularity, and testing. Adhering to these standards ensures that the codebase remains clean, easy to understand, and scalable.

## Security Guidelines
Here, we define security best practices that need to be followed in the project. This includes secure coding techniques, vulnerability prevention, data protection rules, and any compliance requirements.

## Additional Guidelines
This section can include other important standards such as code review processes, commit message conventions, and usage of tools for static code analysis or linting.

Following these standards improves code quality, reduces bugs, and enhances security and maintainability of the project.
